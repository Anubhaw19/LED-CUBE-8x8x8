  So,this whole idea strike to my mind ,when I was participating in very first TechFest event during first year of my college,there I saw the similar model build by someone,which was very interesting and actractive too, to be very honest ,at that moment I was felling like a noob,and there only I decided that one day ,I will make a similar model,after that I started searching about that everywhere like insane, then I got to know about ,there is something called **ARDUINO** ,which is like backbone of this whole model. After that I researched more about Arduino ,watched twenty+ videos on youtube ,read different Aticle and blogs about LED CUBE in different website, one such website is :https://www.instructables.com/Led-Cube-8x8x8/,this clear most of my queries about the procedure and how to initiate this project,also, this github repo helped me alot :https://github.com/itsharryle/LED_CUBE.
